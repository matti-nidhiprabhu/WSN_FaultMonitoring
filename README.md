# WSN Fault Monitoring using Deep learning approach
This project implements a deep learning-based system to detect and classify faulty nodes in WSNs in real time. It has real-time metric tracking (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC), confusion matrices, and a dynamic fault node graph for visualizing faulty sensor behavior. Built with Streamlit for an interactive interface.
